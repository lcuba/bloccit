## Readitt: a Reddit replica to teach the fundamentals of web development and Rails. Made with Rails 5
### Made by Lucas Cuba

Hello, and welcome to my topical message board application, Readitt. Here, users can create a profile, start topics and create posts under those topics, and comment and vote on those posts. You can find a deployed version here: 

This application was written in Rails 5, and was styled using bootstrap. This project doesn't use too many gems, instead it mostly is written with vanilla Rails. 

When testing this application, there are two accounts you may use in addition to creating your own. 

* member@example.com - password: "helloworld" - Standard member given basic permissions
* admin@example.com - password: "helloworld" - Admin account that can perform all operations

Anyway, thanks for stopping by!
